# Linked List C implementaition

<br>

Linked List is a dynamic data structure to store homogeneous data in a sequential format. It stores the data along with the respective memory location for that data. So it consume a more memory but it is efficient than an Array in terms of various operations like insertion, deletion etc.

code to search an element in a singly linked list

**Intro:**

<br>

Searching an element in a linked list is little bit difficult than Array because we can search any element in array using its index but we need hardcore coding to find the same thing in linked list.
